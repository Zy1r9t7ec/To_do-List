# To-Do List Web App

A simple web-based To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## Features

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
- Delete tasks
- Clean and minimal user interface

---

## Project Structure

/ (root)
├── index.html - Main HTML file
├── style.css - Styling for the application
└── app.js - JavaScript logic for the app

---

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- A web browser

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Zy1r9t7ec/To_do-List.git

2. Navigate into the project folder:

cd To_do-List

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser by double-clicking it, or use a local server such as:

python3 -m http.server 8000

---

## How It Works

- `index.html` contains the structure of the To-Do list.
- `style.css` defines the layout and visual styling.
- `app.js` handles:
- Adding new tasks
- Marking tasks as completed
- Removing tasks

---

## Usage

1. Enter a task in the input field.
2. Click the "Add" button or press Enter.
3. Click on a task to toggle its completion state.
4. Click the delete option on a task to remove it.

---

## Limitations and Future Improvements

- Tasks are not saved after a page reload (localStorage can be added later)
- No support for task priority or due dates
- Drag-and-drop reordering is not implemented
